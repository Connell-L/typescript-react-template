# ts-react-template

This is a template repository that generates a typescript react app, with a custom webpack configured. 

Babel, eslint and prettier are also set up.

It is missing a testing framework. The next goal is to set up jest, with testing-library/react. My aim is to have a __test__ root directory set up to write tests in typescript, and to generate test coverage.

Flex goal is to also set up cypress e2e testing.
